#1.1
#When you type in the command ggplot(tweetsPerState, aes(x = n)) why doesnâ€™t anything show up?
#Because you have to mention someting of what sort of data you will make such as geom_box

#1.2
#The aes() is to add aesthetics in the data chart. Such as fill=cut, color = cut


#1.3
#The differenc between fill and color is that fill is to actually fill up the color of the graph (bars, and lines)
#The color only colors the layer which is the outter part of the graph.

#1.4
#They are different in the way of geom_plots. They both contain their default values

#5 decision tree is one of the data structures in computer science. 
#Theres a lot of type of decision trees but the most basic one is the 
#one that has a random value oon top and compare the next value to place
#it on the right or left. Normally, if its bigger than the number than the top one, 
#place it on the right and if its smaller then we place it on the left.
